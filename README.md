# CS-370
Repo made for SNHU CS370

  The objective of this project was to create an intelligent agent that is able to navigate a treasure maze utilizing Q-learning algorithms in order to find the optimal path to the treasure. In this scenario I was working as an AI developer for a gaming company developing a game in which the player must get to the treasure before the intelligent pirate agent does. The pirate must be able to navigate the maze, identifying obstacles and adjusting its pathfinding process as it moves throughout the maze. I was provided with tarter code and a sample environment to place the pirate agent in, and I then created a deep Q-learning algorithm to train the pirate agent to navigate the maze.

  Computer scientists work with data, algorithms, and software to solve complex problems. They design and create new technology, improve existing systems, analyze data to extract insights, and develop algorithms for various purposes like machine learning, cybersecurity, and data management. Their work is crucial in advancing technology, driving innovation in various industries, and addressing societal challenges. They typically follow a structured approach. They begin by thoroughly understanding the problem they're trying to solve, clarifying the requirements, constraints, and desired outcomes. The next step usually involves conducting research to gather relevant information, study existing solutions, and plan the respective approach, which may involve brainstorming, creating prototypes, or analyzing data. After this, a solution or system that addresses the problem effectively is designed. This includes choosing appropriate algorithms, data structures, and technologies, such as the application of Q-learning algorithms in the Treasure Maze. Implementation includes writing code in order to implement the design. This stage involves programming, testing, debugging, and refining the solution. This solution in evaluated to make sure it meets the requirements and performs as expected.

  Regarding ethical responsibilities, computer scientists often have several obligations to both end-users and the organizations that employ them. User data must be handled responsibly, protected from any unauthorized access, and it must be used only for intended purposes. Privacy regulations and coding best practices must also be followed. Systems developed must be reliable, secure, and resilient against cyber threats, with methods including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. Developers and companies alike have to be transparent about how algorithms and systems work, including potential biases or limitations, taking responsibility for the impact of their work on individuals and society. Technology must be accessible to people with disabilities, ensuring equal access and usability for all users. For example, the Treasure Maze game must be able to accomodate mouse and keyboard controls, rather than one or the other.
